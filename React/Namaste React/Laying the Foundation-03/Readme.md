# Laying the foundation

- Use `npx parcel index.html` to ignite the project and host the application.
- Instead of running the above command every time, you can create a script in your `package.json` to simplify it. After adding the script, you can run the application using: `npm run ${script-name}`.

# App.js vs App2.js

- In `main.js` we have used the Jsx and React core to create the react element
- In `app.js` we are using the functional Component
