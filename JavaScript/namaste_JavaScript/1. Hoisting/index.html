    <h1>ðŸ˜‡ Understanding the Hoisting in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior where variable and function
      declarations are moved to the top of their scope before the code is
      executed. This means that you can use functions and variables before you
      declare them in the code (sort of), because JavaScript will "hoist" those
      declarations.
