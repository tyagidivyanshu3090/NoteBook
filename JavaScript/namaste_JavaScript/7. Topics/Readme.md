# call_apply_bind

- `call method`: Executes the function immediately, arguments passed individually.
- `apply()`: Executes the function immediately, arguments passed as an array.
- `bind()`: Returns a new function with the this context (and optionally some arguments) bound. You need to call this new function separately to execute the original function

# Function Currying:

- Currying in JavaScript is a functional programming technique that transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.
- Achieved using `bind method` or `closure`
