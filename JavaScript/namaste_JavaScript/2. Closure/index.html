    <h1>ðŸ˜‡ Understanding Closures in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      A closure is a function that "remembers" variables from its outer scope,
      even after that outer function has finished executing.
    </p>
    <h2>A closure is created when:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A function is defined inside another function.</li>
      <li>The inner function uses variables from the outer function.</li>
      <li>The inner function is returned or called later, and it still has access to those outer variables.</li>
    </ul>
