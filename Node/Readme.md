# Commit 2

- The js Engine [ V8 ] which is used to execute javaScript is written in C++ Language.
- Node.js = V8 Engine + Extra Superpowers ðŸš€
  - Suppose we want to connect to database or make an api call -> the v8 engine cant do that as it only execute js code. so these super power are appende to Node.js
- **Node.js Superpowers**: Node.js extends the capabilities of the V8 engine by adding modules like:
  - fs (File System): For interacting with the filesystem.
  - http/https: For making network requests and creating servers.
  - process: For interacting with the system process.
  - events: For handling asynchronous events.
  - modules like express, axios, mongoose: For simplifying API calls, database interactions, etc.
